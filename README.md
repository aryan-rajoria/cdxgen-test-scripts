# CDXGEN-test-scripts
Quickly creates a docker container and runs some scripts to manually test out cdxgen on multiple projects.

This repository will hold github links to many projects in different languages.

Todo:
1) run cdxgen container
2) do a git pull to a chosen branch (maybe a gh pull in the future)
3) run the desired project, with custom arguments
4) quickly compare the results using (custom-bom-diff)
